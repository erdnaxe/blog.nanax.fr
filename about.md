This website is a way for me to share fast how-to guides to help people.

If you're interrested in my other projects, you should check-out my GitHub profile.

### Credit

This website uses :

* *Jekyll* with the default *Minima* theme.
* *Solarized* color scheme, made by [Ethan Schoonover](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) ;
* a vertical timeline derivated from [codyhouse.co](https://codyhouse.co/) ;
* a set of free retro icons made by Frexy.

You can send me a message on GitHub or post a comment on the website. If I don't answer it means that I'm busy.
