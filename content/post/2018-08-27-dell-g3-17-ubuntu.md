This guide assumes you have a freshly-installed Ubuntu 18.04 installed on your Dell G3.
Following the following steps will recreate the configuration that Dell ships on Ubuntu-preinstalled
G3 laptops.

## Dell OEM customizations

Dell does quite a few modifications to Ubuntu official 16.04 ISO.
This is a non-exhaustive list of what Dell changed.
**Please note that there is no solution yet to make the Goodix fingerprint sensor works.**

### Dell customizations that can be skipped

* **Bluez 5.37**: Bluez 5.48 is default in Ubuntu 18.04,
* **Dell e-star** (`dell-e-star_0.05_all.deb`): e-star logo in unity control panel,
* **Dell Super key** (`dell-super-key_0.04_all.deb`): disable `Super` keyboard key (the one with
  Windows logo) with a gschema[^gschema],
* **Google Chrome** (`google-chrome-stable_64.0.3282.140-1_amd64.deb`): can be installed easily,
* **Add Google Chrome to launcher** (`oem-add-google-chrome-to-launcher_1_all.deb`): add Google
  Chrome to Ubuntu desktop launcher with a gschema[^gschema],
* **A more recent Mesa** (libdrm 2.4.83-1): 2.4.91-2 is default in Ubuntu 18.04,
* Dell blacklists `psmouse` kernel module to remove some warning in kernel logs.
* **Dell EULA** (`dell-eula_1.03_all.deb`): useless information,
* **Dell repository**: useless for this specific laptop.

[^gschema]: GNOME Settings desktop schema, a file to set defaults within gsettings database.

### ACPI OSI

In the package `config-prime-select-intel-all_0.15_all.deb`, Dell ships a config file to make Ubuntu
announces itself as `Linux-Dell-Video` to the ACPI BIOS.
To do the same without a Debian package, create `/etc/default/grub.d/Linux-Dell-Video.cfg` and write:

```bash
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=$(echo $GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX acpi_osi="Linux-Dell-Video" )
```

Then update GRUB configuration by executing in a shell:

```bash
sudo update-grub
```

### Better battery life

Dell uses TLP to manage power consumption and to preserve battery life.

To get the same config as the one Dell ships, install `tlp` and `tlp-rdw` then reboot.

Dell also includes a custom TLP configuration `tlp-sensible_1.1_all.deb` but it is useless with recent versions of Ubuntu.

### Ethernet

Install `r8168-dkms` and reboot to get a fully-working ethernet card.

## Nvidia driver

Dell ships Ubuntu 16.04 with a preconfigured Optimus-ready (PRIME) Nvidia driver and CUDA.
It uses **Nvidia 390.25 driver** that is older those available in Ubuntu 18.04.
The way Optimus works in Ubuntu 18.04 changed a lot and now installing a recent
Nvidia driver will be sufficient to get a working setup.

You can use `ppa:graphics-drivers/ppa` to have newer Nvidia drivers.

Before november 2018, the only way to get a proper PRIME support was to follow the instructions on
[Tim Richardson's Prime-Ubuntu-18.04 project](https://github.com/timrichardson/Prime-Ubuntu-18.04).
This has been fixed in Ubuntu 18.10 and backported in 18.04.

## Tear free screen with Nvidia PRIME

To use PRIME-sync and remove tearing, create `/etc/default/grub.d/Nvidia-DRM.cfg` and write:
```ini
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=$(echo $GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX nvidia-drm.modeset=1 )
```

This will load Nvidia at boot enabling some experimental features that might create instability.
I have been using this configuration so far and I had no issues with Xorg.

## Native Thunderbolt

Make sure you are running a kernel newer than 4.17 to make Linux will announce itself compatible with native Thunderbolt to the UEFI.
You can upgrade to a newer kernel using [Ubuntu LTS Enablement Stack](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/LTSEnablementStack):

```bash
apt install --install-recommends linux-generic-hwe-18.04 xserver-xorg-hwe-18.04
```
