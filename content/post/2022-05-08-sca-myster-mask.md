## Official description

> You will have to analyze the consumption traces of an early implementation
> of the AES made by Myster Mask. Will you be able to exploit these traces to
> make the *difference*?
>
> The part to target corresponds to the **inversion step** in the calculation of the
> S-box in the first round of the AES. **Only this step is implemented**,
> it is not necessary to know the AES since this challenge is specifically focused
> on the inversion step.
> 
> The consumption traces provided correspond to the following call:

> Beware! Myster Mask has protected this inversion by honoring his name.

> SHA256(`traces.npz`) = `d4e16ded8c53f6e295672567cd8bdd3453ebd1318bf353b827c40cda17698fe4`
> SHA256(`inputs.npz`) = `283b4245a36d7d238ba941a247eaaa38cc90d8db2f3c4e7db824d241a6c21603`

We get 4 files: `traces.npz` (side-channel traces), `inputs.npz` (plaintexts), `myster_mask.py` (the algorithm) and `output.txt` (the ciphertext to decode).

![Myster Mask speaking](/assets/images/sca-myster-mask/zorro_meme.png)

## Exploration

`output.txt` contains an initial vector `iv` and a ciphertext `c`.

`myster_mask.py` shows how the masked algorithm works.
We take a look at `mask` and `unmask` functions. After a bit of paper reading,
we learn that this is a multiplicative 5 shares masking in Galois field 256
`GF256`.

![Structure of the algorithm](/assets/images/sca-myster-mask/sca_mask_struct.svg)

The challenge description indicates that side-channel traces correspond to the
execution of this function:

```Python
def masked_inversion(S):
    output = S
    for i in range(5):
        for j in range(16):
            output[j][i] = GF256(S[j][i]) ** 254
    return output
```

![Average of traces.npy](/assets/images/sca-myster-mask/sca_average.png)

We recognize in the averaging of all side-channel traces the 16 iterations of
`j` in 5 iterations of `i`.

*During the challenge I tried multiplying every 5 spikes corresponding to each
masking share, then correlating each {key hypothesis XOR input} on them.
I was unable to recover the key using this method.*

## Proposed solution

[Multiplicative Masking and Power Analysis of AES, by GoliÄ‡, J.D., Tymen, C. (2003)](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F3-540-36400-5_16.pdf)
is a nice ressource to understand and solve this challenge.
They introduce GF256 multiplicative masking
then in section 2 explains how to setup a differential power analysis of AES.

As `GF256(0)` equals 0, calling `mask(0)` will always put a 0 in the first share.
This implies that if `key[i]` and `input[i]` are equals, then
`key[i] XOR input[i]` is 0 i.e. the masked first share is 0.

Let's attack each \\(i\\)-th key byte separately.
For each \\(K\\) key byte hypothesis, let's filter \\(M\\) traces in which
`key[i]` and `input[i]` are equals.
Then we compare the average of \\(M\\) to the average trace. If the difference is
the most important, then it means that the hypothesis may be the right key.

```Python
import numpy as np
from Crypto.Cipher import AES

inputs = np.load("inputs.npz")["inputs"]
traces = np.load("traces.npz")["traces"]

C = np.average(traces, axis=0)

key = [0] * 16
for i in range(16):
    max_diff = []
    for K in range(256):
        M = [trace for inp, trace in zip(inputs, traces) if inp[i]^K == 0]
        C_K = np.average(M, axis=0)
        max_diff.append(max(np.abs(C_K - C)))
    
    print(max(max_diff), np.argmax(max_diff))
    key[i] = int(np.argmax(max_diff))

# iv and c from output.txt
iv = bytes.fromhex("ec35aba34b09ddaf40133465cf99e0e4")
c = bytes.fromhex("592eefe2c8c2aa5cc4088909e80ed4342198<snip>")
d = AES.new(bytes(key), AES.MODE_CBC, iv=iv).decrypt(c)
print(d)
```

After some seconds, we get the flag:

```
0.03693260569852941 224
[...]
0.035091276041666675 63
