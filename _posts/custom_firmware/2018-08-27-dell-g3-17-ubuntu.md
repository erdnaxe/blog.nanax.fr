This post lists Dell modifications made to pre-installed Ubuntu 16.04 on Dell G3 and focuses on
installing a fully-working Ubuntu 18.04.

This guide assumes you have a clean Ubuntu 18.04 installed on your Dell G3.
Following the following steps will recreate the configuration that Dell ships on Ubuntu-preinstalled
G3 laptops.

## Dell OEM customization

Dell does quite a few modifications to Ubuntu official 16.04 ISO.
This is a non-exhaustive list of what Dell changed.
Please note that there is no solution yet to make the fingerprint sensor works.

### Useless customization

* **Bluez 5.37** : Bluez 5.48 is default in Ubuntu 18.04,
* **Dell e-star** (*dell-e-star_0.05_all.deb*) : e-star logo in unity control panel,
* **Dell Super key** (*dell-super-key_0.04_all.deb*) : disable super keyboard key (the one with
  Windows logo) by default by creating a gschema,
* **Google Chrome** (*google-chrome-stable_64.0.3282.140-1_amd64.deb*) : can be installed easily,
* **Add Google Chrome to launcher** (*oem-add-google-chrome-to-launcher_1_all.deb*) : a useless
  gschema,
* **A more recent Mesa** (libdrm 2.4.83-1) : 2.4.91-2 is default in Ubuntu 18.04,
* **Dell EULA** (*dell-eula_1.03_all.deb*) : useless information,
* **Dell repository** : useless for this specific laptop.

### ACPI OSI

In the package *config-prime-select-intel-all_0.15_all.deb*, Dell ships a config file to make Ubuntu
announces itself as "Linux-Dell-Video" to the ACPI BIOS.
To do the same change, create `/etc/default/grub.d/Linux-Dell-Video.cfg` and write :
```bash
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=$(echo $GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX acpi_osi="Linux-Dell-Video" )
```

Then update GRUB configuration by executing in a shell :
```bash
sudo update-grub
```

### Better battery life

Dell uses TLP to manage power consumption and to preserve battery life.

To get the same config as the one Dell ships, install :

* `tlp` and `tlp-rdw`,
* [tlp-sensible_1.1_all.deb]({{site.url}}/assets/pkg/tlp-sensible_1.1_all.deb) which contain custom Dell configuration (GPL-2+ package by Canonical).

Just reboot and voil√†!

### Ethernet

Just install `r8168-dkms` and reboot to get a fully-working ethernet card.

### Touchpad

That is optional, but Dell blacklists `psmouse` kernel module to remove some warning in kernel
logs.

To blacklist this module, install
[modprobe-blacklist-psmouse_2_all.deb]({{site.url}}/assets/pkg/modprobe-blacklist-psmouse_2_all.deb)
(GPL-2+ package developed by [Canonical](https://code.launchpad.net/~oem-solutions-engineers/somerville/modprobe-blacklist-psmouse)).

### Nvidia driver

Dell ships Ubuntu 16.04 with a preconfigured Optimus-ready (prime) Nvidia driver and CUDA.

It uses **Nvidia 390.25 driver** that is older those available in Ubuntu 18.04.

The way Optimus works in Ubuntu 18.04 changed a lot since (and the official method will result in a
black screen...).

We will cover how to get a similar configuration in
[the following section](#install-nvidia-prime-on-1804).

## Install Nvidia prime on 18.04

Follow instructions on
[Tim Richardson's Prime-Ubuntu-18.04 project](https://github.com/timrichardson/Prime-Ubuntu-18.04).

For the following section, you need to use `ppa:graphics-drivers/ppa` or newer kernel won't load the
Nvidia module.

## Native Thunderbolt

Use UKUU to install a kernel newer. With a > 4.17 kernel, Linux will announce itself compatible with
native Thunderbolt to the UEFI. Another way to do so is to force native Thunderbolt in the UEFI.
